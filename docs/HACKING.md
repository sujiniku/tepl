Tepl development
================

Contributions are no longer accepted
------------------------------------

And new maintainers are not accepted either.

But the source code is open, you can copy it freely and create a new project.
What I just ask for the new project:
- Must have a different project name.
- And it must be possible to install Tepl plus the new project in parallel on
  the same prefix. For example by just bumping the major/API version of the
  library to something far apart.

Notes
-----

Tepl follows the same guidelines and code conventions as GtkSourceView. See the
[HACKING file of GtkSourceView](https://github.com/gedit-org/gtksourceview/blob/master/HACKING).
