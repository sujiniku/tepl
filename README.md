Tepl - Text editor product line
===============================

This is version 5.99.0 of Tepl.

Tepl is a library that eases the development of GtkSourceView-based text
editors and IDEs.

Tepl was previously named Gtef (GTK text editor framework). The project has
been renamed in June 2017 to have a more beautiful name. The end of Tepl is
pronounced like in “apple”.

The Tepl library is free software and is released under the terms of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, see the `LICENSES/` directory for more
information.
