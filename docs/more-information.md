Tepl - more information
=======================

Tepl is the acronym for “Text editor product line”.

Tepl was previously named Gtef (GTK text editor framework). The project has
been renamed in June 2017 to have a more beautiful name. The end of Tepl is
pronounced like in “apple”.

[Amtk](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Amtk) is now in a separate git
repository (it was initially developed in Tepl).
